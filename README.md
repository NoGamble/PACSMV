#### This is a summer project of Machine Learning training.
It's basically about machine learning and some fundamental information. 
In This project, we'll mainly explore the basic ideas about Deep Learning(DL) and some SOTA methohs on preva;ent topics.
##### Overview
###### Session-1: MLP and Logist Regression
- Logistic Regression
Using LR on MNIST datasets.
- MLP
The most basic MLP model to solve MNIST.
- requirements.txt: python environment
###### Session-2: CNN
Basic CNN architecture
###### Session-3: Generative Methods(Auto Encoder, GAN...)
###### Session-4: NLP, RNN and LSTM
###### Session-5: Reinforcement Learning
###### Session-6: Transformer

###### FINAL PROJECT
- LLaDAï¼š[]

In this Final project, we planned to fine-tune a LLaDa-Indtruct 8B model and evaluate the post-trained model on a specificated finacial datasets. In the original paper, an essential phenomenon was found that the post-trained model--LLaDA-Instruct 8B performed even worse in some benchmarks like MMLU. The author attributed this to the suboptimal post training datasets. Thus, we aim to ehhance its performance on certain domain using SFT as well. The project is based on CoLab.
